# working:
1.first fetched data from different websites and merged them to a single data set with some common attributes
2.Also we fetched data of some particular diseases like diabetes,kindey failure
3.we do some preproseccing and made a prediction model that helps to predict probability of 
  occurance 
4.Then we use this model to predict the probalities of different persons on super dataset as they have some common attribute.
5.Added probability of having a particular disease into our super dataset
6.on the basis of these predicted values a sales person can decide this particular person is very likely to take health insurance.
